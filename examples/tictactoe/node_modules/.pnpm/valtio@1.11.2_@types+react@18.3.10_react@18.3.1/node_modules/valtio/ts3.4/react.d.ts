/**
 * useSnapshot
 *
 * Create a local snapshot that catches changes. This hook actually returns a wrapped snapshot in a proxy for
 * render optimization instead of a plain object compared to `snapshot()` method.
 * Rule of thumb: read from snapshots, mutate the source.
 * The component will only re-render when the parts of the state you access have changed, it is render-optimized.
 *
 * @example A
 * function Counter() {
 *   const snap = useSnapshot(state)
 *   return (
 *     <div>
 *       {snap.count}
 *       <button onClick={() => ++state.count}>+1</button>
 *     </div>
 *   )
 * }
 *
 * [Notes]
 * Every object inside your proxy also becomes a proxy (if you don't use "ref"), so you can also use them to create
 * the local snapshot as seen on example B.
 *
 * @example B
 * function ProfileName() {
 *   const snap = useSnapshot(state.profile)
 *   return (
 *     <div>
 *       {snap.name}
 *     </div>
 *   )
 * }
 *
 * Beware that you still can replace the child proxy with something else so it will break your snapshot. You can see
 * above what happens with the original proxy when you replace the child proxy.
 *
 * > console.log(state)
 * { profile: { name: "valtio" } }
 * > childState = state.profile
 * > console.log(childState)
 * { name: "valtio" }
 * > state.profile.name = "react"
 * > console.log(childState)
 * { name: "react" }
 * > state.profile = { name: "new name" }
 * > console.log(childState)
 * { name: "react" }
 * > console.log(state)
 * { profile: { name: "new name" } }
 *
 * `useSnapshot()` depends on the original reference of the child proxy so if you replace it with a new one, the component
 * that is subscribed to the old proxy won't receive new updates because it is still subscribed to the old one.
 *
 * In this case we recommend the example C or D. On both examples you don't need to worry with re-render,
 * because it is render-optimized.
 *
 * @example C
 * const snap = useSnapshot(state)
 * return (
 *   <div>
 *     {snap.profile.name}
 *   </div>
 * )
 *
 * @example D
 * const { profile } = useSnapshot(state)
 * return (
 *   <div>
 *     {profile.name}
 *   </div>
 * )
